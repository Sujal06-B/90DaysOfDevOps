Check Running Processes:
Used "ps aux" and "top" commands to view all running processes along with their CPU and memory usage.
This helps identify active processes and resource-heavy applications.

Inspect a systemd Service:
Checked the status of a systemd service using "systemctl status nginx". 
The output showed whether the service was active, its process ID, uptime, and recent logs. 
Verified startup configuration using "systemctl is-enabled nginx".

Troubleshooting Flow:
If an issue occurs, first check the service status using "systemctl status". 
If the service is not running, review logs using "journalctl -u nginx".
Restart the service using systemctl restart nginx and recheck the status.
If the issue persists, inspect resource usage and configuration files.

Conclusion:
These basic commands provide a quick and effective way to monitor processes, inspect services, and perform initial troubleshooting on a Linux system.
