Day 2 Assignment: 

The core components of Linux (kernel, user space, init/systemd)

Answer : The linux is an operating system which has different components that are given below in Linux architecture

Linux Architecture:

Application / user  : 
-In this layer user uses the different application which directly communicate with the shell and gives the response 
to the user like notpad.
        |
Shell : 
-Shell is the program wirtten in c language that gives the instructions to kernel to perform a task. from here we 
can give the commands and talk to kernel 
- We can access shell using the terminal this is the command line interface (CLI) 
        |
Kernel :
-Kernel is the heart of linux operating system which manages the system resources like process management 
-It is the bridge between software and hardware 
        |
Hardware:
-These are touchable things which is used to give input or to show the output to the user like keyboard for input and 
monitor for output.


[] init :
- init is the process which has the process id (PID) 1 which start after loading the Linux Kernel 
- After loading the GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader).


[] user-space services:
- It is a service.
- All the applications and programs you use (like browsers, games, text editors) that run in a separate, protected 
area of memory, isolated from the core operating system (the kernel), which handles hardware.



(*)How processes are created and managed : 
* Process : 
- An active instance of a running program is called process.
- In linux each and every thing is process. 
- Process is the task which is start and end after completing .
- The every command we enter is a process like ping google.com is a process 
- It has different life cycle stages like Start - Ready - Running - Waiting - Terminated.


(*) What systemd does and why it matters?
[] systemd:
- It is a default system service manager.
- d stands for daemon which means the processes running in the background.
- Offers faster parallel boots.
- Simplifies administration across different distributions compared to older, slower init systems and make the system fasters.
