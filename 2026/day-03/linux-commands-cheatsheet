Today’s goal is to build your Linux command confidence.

You will create a cheat sheet of commands focused on:

Process management : 

Process: Process is instance of program execution 
- Everything in linux is process.
- We have follwing commands that are used for process management: 

1. ps : It gives the snapshot of current processes.
2.top : It displays the linux processes in the table format.
3.htop: It displays the linux processes in graphical and colorful format.
4.kill : This is used to kill the process using PID(Process ID)
        - option like -9 that kills the process forefully
        -ex. kill -9 3422(PID)
5.pkill : This is used to kill process using it's name.
        - pkill firefox
6.bg/fg : Used to move between background and foreground.
7.nice : Used to set the priority that defines which process will run first and last 



File system: "All in linux is file or folder" 

-Following are File System commands: 

1.mkdir:Used to make Directory.
2.rmdir:Used to remove empty directory
3.rm: Used to remove file and directories (forcefully/recursively using the -r
4.touch: Used to create empty file.
5.cat:Used to view , create and append the file.
6.cp: to copy the file and directories.
7.mv:to move or rename files and directories.



Networking troubleshooting

1.ping 
Verifies IP-level connectivity to a host and measures latency and packet loss.

2.ip addr
Displays IP addresses and status of all network interfaces.

3.ifconfig
Used to displays or configures network interface parameters.

4.ip route
Views and modifies the kernel routing tables (replaces the older route command).



This is the command toolkit you will reuse for years.
